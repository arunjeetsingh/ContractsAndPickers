# ContractsAndPickers
Code from the Build 2014 session http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2014/2-520. Please update AppKey and AppSecret in \TumbleMe\TumbleMe.Shared\TumblrApi\TumblrHelper.cs before getting started.

This sample app shows how to:
* Write an app that uses the WebApplicationBroker on both Windows and Windows Phone. Uses clever pre-processor voodoo to hide differences in desktop and phone APIs
* Write a share target for Windows Desktop and Windows Phone
* Write a file open provider for both Windows Desktop and Windows Phone
